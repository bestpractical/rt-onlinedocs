RT::OnlineDocs adds a "Developer Documentation" menu to the RT user interface.
This tool provides a browsable user interface to the RT API documentation for
the running RT instance. I'm indebted to Autrijus Tang who contributed the
first version of this code.

In RT 3.8.0 and newer you can enable and disable estension using @Plugins option:

    Set( @Plugins, 'RT::OnlineDocs' );

Be sure to stop and start your webserver to fully enable this RT extension
